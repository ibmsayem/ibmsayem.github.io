A perennial need for safety in the community depends on country, city, and district. In some instances, feeling safe is required on a 24/7 basis. A popular and cost-effective solution based on the Raspberry Pi has the promise of being both user-friendly and costeffective. It pairs the Raspberry Pi to a camera module for face recognition. It learns to detect those with granted access to the specified area under protection. Such stored faces are the subject of system training. If during operation the system recognizes the face in the dataset, then the camera shows the matching name with a confidence level possibly granting access, but alternatively it takes a photo of the subject and sends it as an email notifications warning. The proposed system can implement face recognition even from poor quality images performing well over both known and unknown datasets. Face recognition leverages techniques from the OpenCV library and is written in the Python language.
